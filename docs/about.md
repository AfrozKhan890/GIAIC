# About This Textbook

## Purpose & Vision

This textbook bridges the gap between artificial intelligence theory and physical robotic implementation. We believe that the future of AI is embodied—intelligence must interact with and understand the physical world.

### Target Audience

**Primary Readers:**
- University students in robotics/AI programs
- Engineers transitioning to robotics field
- Researchers exploring embodied intelligence
- Hobbyists building advanced robotic projects

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic Python programming
- Understanding of linear algebra
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts
- (Optional) Experience with Linux systems

### Why Physical AI Matters

1. **Human-Centered Design**: Humanoid robots can operate in our world without modification
2. **Generalization**: Physical AI learns principles that transfer across tasks
3. **Real-World Impact**: From healthcare to manufacturing, embodied AI solves practical problems
4. **Scientific Discovery**: Understanding intelligence requires understanding embodiment

### Pedagogical Approach

**Learning by Building:**
Each chapter includes:
- Theoretical foundations
- Practical implementations
- Code examples
- Mini-projects
- Further reading

**Progressive Difficulty:**
- Chapters 1-3: Foundational concepts
- Chapters 4-7: Core techniques
- Chapters 8-10: Advanced applications

### Open Source Philosophy

All code, datasets, and resources in this textbook are open source. We believe in:
- Accessibility: Anyone, anywhere can learn
- Collaboration: Community improvements welcome
- Transparency: Clear explanations of all techniques
- Reproducibility: All results can be replicated
