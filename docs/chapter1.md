# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that operate in the physical world. Unlike digital AI that exists purely in software, Physical AI has a body and interacts with real environments.

## Why Physical AI Matters?

Humanoid robots are designed to operate in human-centered environments. They can:
- Navigate stairs and doors built for humans
- Use tools designed for human hands
- Interact naturally with people

## Embodied Intelligence

The concept of "embodied intelligence" means that intelligence emerges from the interaction between:
1. **The brain** (AI algorithms)
2. **The body** (sensors and actuators)
3. **The environment** (physical constraints)

## Course Roadmap

This textbook covers:
1. **ROS 2** - The robotic nervous system
2. **Gazebo** - Digital twin simulation
3. **NVIDIA Isaac** - AI robot brain
4. **Humanoid Robotics** - Balance and locomotion
5. **Capstone Project** - Autonomous humanoid

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this course, you will:
- Understand Physical AI principles
- Master ROS 2 for robotic control
- Simulate robots with Gazebo
- Develop with NVIDIA Isaac platform
- Design humanoid robots
