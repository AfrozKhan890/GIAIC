# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Physical AI?
**Physical AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems that operate in the physical world, combining perception, reasoning, and action to interact with real environments. Unlike purely digital AI, Physical AI has embodiment—sensors to perceive the world and actuators to affect it.

### Who is this textbook for?
This textbook is designed for:
- **Students** learning robotics and AI  
- **Researchers** exploring embodied intelligence  
- **Engineers** building intelligent robotic systems  
- **Educators** teaching AI and robotics courses  
- **Enthusiasts** interested in the future of AI  

### Do I need prior robotics experience?
No prior robotics experience is required, but the following will help:
- Basic Python programming  
- Understanding of neural networks  
- Familiarity with linear algebra  

The textbook starts with foundational concepts and builds up gradually.

### Is this textbook free?
Yes, this textbook is completely free and open source. All content and code examples are publicly available.
